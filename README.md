# Finding Prime Number in Python

These are 2 methods to find a prime number in a normal or an optimal way with python.

In both methods there is a function named is_prime() which recieves an integer as an input and returns the Boolean value of True or False whether the input integer is prime number or not.

Note: The optimal method is very useful for identifing large prime numbers very quickly.
